 Projects

1. Iris Classifier

The Iris Classifier project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on sepal and petal measurements.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Creative visualizations for output

**Directory:** `./DATA SCIENCE/Iris_Classifier`

2. Movie Rating Prediction

The Movie Rating Prediction project focuses on predicting movie ratings using various machine learning algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, SVR)
- Model evaluation and visualization for comparison

**Directory:** `./DATA SCIENCE/Movie_Rating_Prediction`

3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset from Kaggle.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and handling imbalanced data
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of results using Dash
